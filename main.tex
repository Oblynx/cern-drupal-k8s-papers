\abstract{%
The infrastructure behind \href{https://home.cern}{home.cern} and 1000 other Drupal websites serves more than 15,000 unique visitors daily.
To best serve the site owners, a small engineering team needs development speed to adapt to their evolving needs and operational velocity to troubleshoot emerging problems rapidly.
We designed a new Web Frameworks platform by extending Kubernetes to replace the ageing physical infrastructure and reduce the dependency on homebrew components.

The new platform is modular, built around standard components and thus less complex to operate.
Some requirements are covered solely by upstream industry-standard projects, 
whereas others by components shared across CERN's web hosting platforms.
We leverage the \href{https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/}{Operator framework} and the Kubernetes API
to get observability, policy enforcement, access control and auditing, and high availability for free.
Thanks to containers and namespaces, websites are isolated.
This isolation clarifies security boundaries and minimizes attack surface, while empowering site owners.

As the project enters its pilot phase, at CHEP 2021 we will present the design and operational insights of this system, demonstrating how we drastically reduced our technical debt.
We will be available to discuss all the details.
