\abstract{%
The infrastructure behind \href{https://home.cern}{home.cern} and 1500 other Drupal websites serves more than [24k unique visitors daily].
To best serve the site owners, a small Drupal team needs development speed to adapt to their evolving needs and operational velocity to troubleshoot emerging problems rapidly.
We designed a new web frameworks platform by extending Kubernetes to replace the ageing linux infrastructure and reduce the dependence on homebrew components.

The new platform is modular, built around standard components and thus less complex to operate.
Some requirements are covered solely by upstream industry-standard projects, 
whereas others by components shared across CERN's web hosting platforms.
We leverage the \href{https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/}{Operator framework} and the Kubernetes API
to get observability, policy enforcement, access control and auditing, and high availability for free.
Thanks to containers and namespaces, websites are isolated.
This isolation clarifies security boundaries and minimizes attack surface, while empowering site owners.

As the project enters its pilot phase, at vCHEP 2021 we will present the design and operational insights of this system, demonstrating how we drastically reduced our technical debt.
We will be available to discuss all the details.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Your text comes here. Separate text sections with
\section{Section title}
\label{sec-1}

Don't forget to give each section, subsection, subsubsection, and
paragraph a unique label (see Sect.~\ref{sec-1}).

For one-column wide figures use syntax of figure~\ref{fig-1}

\includegraphics[width=1cm,clip]{tiger}
\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\label{fig-1}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

For two-column wide figures use syntax of figure~\ref{fig-2}
\begin{figure*}
\centering
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file. See example above.
% If not, use
\vspace*{5cm}       % Give the correct figure height in cm
\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\label{fig-2}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure*}

For figure with sidecaption legend use syntax of figure
\begin{figure}
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
\centering
\sidecaption
\includegraphics[width=5cm,clip]{tiger}
\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\label{fig-3}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

For tables use syntax in table~\ref{tab-1}.
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Please write your table caption here}
\label{tab-1}       % Give a unique label
% For LaTeX tables you can use
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
first & second & third  \\\hline
number & number & number \\
number & number & number \\\hline
\end{tabular}
% Or use
\vspace*{5cm}  % with the correct table height
\end{table}
%
% BibTeX or Biber users please use (the style is already called in the class, ensure that the "woc.bst" style is in your local directory)
% \bibliography{name or your bibliography database}
%
% Non-BibTeX users please use
%
\begin{thebibliography}{}
%
% and use \bibitem to create references.
%
\bibitem{RefJ}
% Format for Journal Reference
Journal Author, Journal \textbf{Volume}, page numbers (year)
% Format for books
\bibitem{RefB}
Book Author, \textit{Book title} (Publisher, place, year) page numbers
% etc
\end{thebibliography}
