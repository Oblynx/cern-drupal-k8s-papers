\subsubsection*{Summary: what were our main points}

- reuse across web frameworks
- extensibility to different Content Management Systems

\subsubsection*{Limitations of this work, what did we not put in because of space / pilot phase}

- design not complete (DBOD integration, application metrics and log processing)
- migrations in Q2 2021

\subsubsection*{Directions to explore}

- support additional CMS (WordPress) as a Service
- deeper observability inside PHP
- metrics/log processing and root cause analysis
- intrusion detection
