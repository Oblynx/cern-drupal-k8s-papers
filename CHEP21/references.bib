	abstract = {Do brains compute? How do brains learn? How are intelligence and language achieved in the human brain? In this pursuit, we develop a formal calculus and associated programming language for brain computation, based on the assembly hypothesis, ﬁrst proposed by Hebb: the basic unit of memory and computation in the brain is an assembly, a sparse distribution over neurons. We show that assemblies can be realized efﬁciently and neuroplausibly by using random projection, inhibition, and plasticity. Repeated applications of this RP\&C primitive (random projection and cap) lead to (1) stable assembly creation through projection; (2) association and pattern completion; and ﬁnally (3) merge, where two assemblies form a higher-level assembly and, eventually, hierarchies. Further, these operations are composable, allowing the creation of stable computational circuits and structures. We argue that this functionality, in the presence of merge in particular, might underlie language and syntax in humans.},

These operations correspond to properties of assemblies observed in experiments, and can be shown, analytically and through simulations, to be realizable by generic, randomly connected populations of neurons with Hebbian plasticity and inhibition. Assemblies and their operations constitute a computational model of the brain which we call the Assembly Calculus, occupying a level of detail intermediate between the level of spiking neurons and synapses and that of the whole brain. The resulting computational system can be shown, under assumptions, to be, in principle, capable of carrying out arbitrary computations. We hypothesize that something like it may underlie higher human cognitive functions such as reasoning, planning, and language. In particular, we propose a plausible brain architecture based on assemblies for implementing the syntactic processing of language in cortex, which is consistent with recent experimental results.},

With ever-increasing data center size, complexities in software applications and dynamic traffic workload patterns, automatically detecting performance anomalies is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose RAD, a lightweight runtime anomaly detection technique that does not require application level instrumentation and can be easily implemented for detecting anomalies in multi-tier cloud-based Web services. In particular, we focus on anomalies that are difficult to detect by simply monitoring system level metrics alone, such as anomalies that are caused by contention from within a service and also those caused by shared resource contention by other services running on the cloud. RAD continuously monitors service resource metrics and uses a queuing network model to detect performance anomalies at runtime. Additionally, RAD uses historical data and implements a statistical methodology to diagnose the root cause of an anomaly. We evaluate RAD on a private cloud and also on the EC2 public cloud platform to show that RAD incurs extremely low levels of performance overhead on the service and is effective for detecting anomalies in both multi-tier monolithic services and microservices.},

	abstract = {The high complexity and dynamics of the microservice architecture make its application diagnosis extremely challenging. Static troubleshooting approaches may fail to obtain reliable model applies for frequently changing situations. Even if we know the calling dependency of services, we lack a more dynamic diagnosis mechanism due to the existence of indirect fault propagation. Besides, algorithm based on single metric usually fail to identify the root cause of anomaly, as single type of metric is not enough to characterize the anomalies occur in diverse services. In view of this, we design a novel tool, named AutoMAP, which enables dynamic generation of service correlations and automated diagnosis leveraging multiple types of metrics. In AutoMAP, we propose the concept of anomaly behavior graph to describe the correlations between services associated with different types of metrics. Two binary operations, as well as a similarity function on behavior graph are defined to help AutoMAP choose appropriate diagnosis metric in any particular scenario. Following the behavior graph, we design a heuristic investigation algorithm by using forward, self, and backward random walk, with an objective to identify the root cause services. To demonstrate the strengths of AutoMAP, we develop a prototype and evaluate it in both simulated environment and real-work enterprise cloud system. Experimental results clearly indicate that AutoMAP achieves over 90\% precision, which significantly outperforms other selected baseline methods. AutoMAP can be quickly deployed in a variety of microservice-based systems without any system knowledge. It also supports introduction of various expert knowledge to improve accuracy.},

	doi = {10.1002/cpe.5306},
	abstract = {Cloud computing is a model for on‐demand access to shared resources based on the pay‐per‐use policy. In order to efficiently manage the resources, a continuous analysis of the operational state of the system is required to be able to detect the performance degradations and malfunctioned resources as soon as possible. Every change in the workload, hardware condition, or software code can change the state of the system from normal to abnormal, which causes the performance and quality of service degradations. These changes or anomalies vary from a simple gradual increase in the load to flash crowds, hardware faults, software bugs, etc. In this paper, we propose Isolation‐Forest based anomaly detection (IFAD) framework based on the unsupervised Isolation technique for anomaly detection in a multi‐attribute space of performance indicators for web‐based applications. Unsupervised nature of the algorithm and its fast execution make this algorithm most suitable for the environments with dynamic nature where the patterns of data change frequently. The experiment results demonstrate that IFAD can achieve good detection accuracy especially in terms of precision for multiple types of the anomaly. Moreover, we show the importance of validating the accuracy of anomaly detection algorithms with regard to both Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Precision‐Recall AUC (PRAUC) in an extensive set of comparisons including multiple unsupervised algorithms. The demonstration of the effectiveness of each algorithm shown by PRAUC results indicates the importance of PRAUC in selecting suitable anomaly detection algorithm, which is largely ignored in the literature.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting unknown quality-of-service (QoS) data based on historical QoS records is vital in web service recommendation or selection. Recently, latent factor (LF) model has been widely and successfully applied to QoS prediction because it is accurate and scalable under many circumstances. Hence, state-of-the-art methods in QoS prediction are primarily based on LF. They improve the basic LF-based models by identifying the neighborhoods of QoS data based on some additional geographical information. However, the additional geographical information may be difficult to collect in considering information security, identity privacy, and commercial interests in real-world applications. Besides, they ignore the reliability of QoS data while unreliable ones are often mixed in. To address these issues, this paper proposes a data-aware latent factor (DALF) model to achieve highly accurate QoS prediction, where ‘data-aware’ means DALF can easily implement the predictions according to the characteristics of QoS data. The main idea is to incorporate a density peaks based clustering method into an LF model to discover the neighborhoods and unreliable ones of QoS data. Experimental results on two benchmark real-world web service QoS datasets demonstrate that DALF has better performance than the state-of-the-art models.},

Existing works mostly extract the features of the description and query independently, downgrading them into word-level calculation, which can not jointly extract the accurate semantics. For this issue, this work explores a way to enable the semantic matching for the contents (including words, phrases, or sentences) in query and the sentences in service description, by mapping words and sentences into the same semantic space. Specifically, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian probabilistic model, bi-Directional Hybrid Priors Topic Model (bi-HPTM), to capture the textual semantics of the words and sentences in a probabilistic simplex, which provides a flexible operation to build the semantic links from the queries to service descriptions. Meanwhile, the textual semantics generated by bi-HPTM is highly interpretable that help to understand the user requirements. The proposed model is examined by ProgrammableWeb. Experimental results demonstrate that bi-HPTM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for semantic service discovery on service classification and retrieval. The visualizations of the nearest-neighbored queries and descriptions show the insights of our model on capturing the latent semantics of Web services.},

	abstract = {Offering a secured shared hosting environment for web applications is not a trivial task. In addition to a well secured system configuration, up-to-date shared hosting are still exposed to security threats by compromised web applications that serve as spam relay, distributed denial of service actors, phishing page hosting and drive-by download page hosting to name a few. As a result, the availability of the server could suffer from a bad IP address reputation and thus, blocked access to all accounts in the server, not only the compromised account. The emergence of web application firewalls (WAF) manages to close the gap by thoroughly analysing HTTP requests in search of known vulnerabilities. However, as any misuse type mechanism, it falls short at discovering zero-day attacks or already compromised environment. In this paper, an anomaly detection model is proposed as a very helpful tool to start building an efficient intrusion detection system adapted to a specific web application or to assist a forensic analysis. The learning phase does not need past activities nor prior knowledge of the web application and its underlying architecture, making it a very simple yet powerful tool for reducing the access log entries for further analysis.},

In this paper, we introduce an extension of this framework, which can detect anomalies earlier via incremental analysis instead of the existing offline analysis approach. In the extended version, we periodically process the log data that is accumulated so far. We conducted controlled experiments based on a benchmark dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. We repeated our experiments with various periods that determine the frequency of analysis as well as the size of the data processed each time. Results showed that our online analysis can improve anomaly detection time significantly while keeping the accuracy level same as that is obtained with the offline approach. The only exceptional case, where the accuracy is compromised, rarely occurs when the analysis is triggered before all the log data associated with a particular session of events are collected.},

	abstract = {Computer networks are present everywhere, making them a key aspect to the proper functioning of products and services that are often served exclusively through the Internet. The pervasive nature of computer networks makes them particularly suitable to attacks. Therefore, more than just functional systems, we are also looking for systems that are reliable, available, scalable and secure. 
 A solution to meet the growing demands of industries and customers alike is cloud computing. Among several other advantages of this paradigm, the possibility of increased profits by reducing costs with infrastructure and software licenses, while allowing for virtually unlimited growth is particularly relevant. However, these advantages are many times shadowed by the increased security risks that steam from having different entities involved, with relationships and responsibilities not properly identified. This may lead to misuse or malicious attacks against cloud computing, which may compromise sensitive information that is stored in shared third party facilities, and many open issues still prevail. 
 Due to these and other issues, it is extremely important to devise new solutions that increase the trustworthiness of cloud computing environments and help to keep the continued growth in demand for virtualized resources. Facing this challenge, this work aims to study, analyze, propose, develop and evaluate several models and mechanisms to fill these gaps. Firstly, a systematic approach for selecting a group of candidate predictors that is suitable for cloud network traffic prediction is proposed. On the basis of this scenario, a predictor model for cloud network traffic that involves a tradeoff between prediction error, historical data dependence, computational costs, and timely response is proposed. Next, an Anomaly Detection System to support decision-making and counter attack malicious actions against cloud computing systems is presented. This contribution relies on network traffic prediction to obtain features that represent the expected appropriate behaviour of the cloud network traffic used jointly with a Support Vector Machine model for detecting anomalous events in the cloud environment. Finally, a mechanism for determining the similarity level between features of the alarms is proposed. This mechanism aims to optimize the efficiency for generating alarms, decreasing the network data traffic to manage the IDS and its associated transfer costs. The benefits and drawbacks of the contributions were demonstrated in realistic simulations using data from real network traces. Furthermore, the evaluations were conducted with well-known metrics and the results show that all the proposed mechanisms were able to outperform similar proposals in literature.},

Software as a service (SaaS) is getting an increasing potential as a cloud-based option for using software applications in a payper-use manner. A critical challenge in SaaS model is continuous attestation of the compliance with quality of service (QoS) metrics stated in SLAs. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting performance anomalies in cloud software services. The proposed method uses correlation analysis between computing resources utilization and workload characteristics. This is done by comparing the correlation values to a reference load test values performed before the SaaS deployment to identify deviations and notify the system administrator about it. The testing scenario operates in two steps. First, running a standard benchmark on a virtual machine to simulate workload and record the correlation between workload and available computing resources utilization (i.e., CPU, RAM, HDD, and Network). Second, the same benchmark is executed again but with changing the workload characteristics through injecting additional queries or changing the computing resources configuration values of the virtual machine. The changes are only present on specific time points to testify the detection rate. Results on standard benchmarks TPC-C, TPC-D and TPC-W showed a promising detection rate that can assure SLA targeted quality aspects such as reliability, scalability and security.},

In this paper we introduce and discuss an online cloud anomaly detection approach, comprising dedicated detection components of our cloud resilience architecture. More specifically, we exhibit the applicability of novelty detection under the one-class support Vector Machine (SVM) formulation at the hypervisor level, through the utilisation of features gathered at the system and network levels of a cloud node. We demonstrate that our scheme can reach a high detection accuracy of over 90\% whilst detecting various types of malware and DoS attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate the merits of considering not only system-level data, but also network-level data depending on the attack type. Finally, the paper shows that our approach to detection using dedicated monitoring components per VM is particularly applicable to cloud scenarios and leads to a flexible detection system capable of detecting new malware strains with no prior knowledge of their functionality or their underlying instructions.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection can infer the presence of errors without observing the target services, but detecting variations in the observable parts of the system on which the services reside. This is a promising technique in complex software-intensive systems, because either instrumenting the services’ internals is exceedingly time-consuming, or encapsulation makes them not accessible. Unfortunately, in such systems anomaly detection is often ineffective due to their dynamicity, which implies changes in the services or their expected workload. Here we present our approach to enhance the efficacy of anomaly detection in complex, dynamic software-intensive systems. After discussing the related challenges, we present MADneSs, an anomaly detection framework tailored for the above systems that includes an adaptive multi-layer monitoring module. Monitored data are then processed by the anomaly detector, which adapts its parameters depending on the current system behavior. An anomaly alert is provided if the analysis conducted by the anomaly detector identify unexpected trends in the data. MADneSs is evaluated through an experimental campaign on two service-oriented architectures; software faults are injected in the application layer, and detected through monitoring of underlying system layers. Lastly, we quantitatively and qualitatively discuss our results with respect to state-of-the-art solutions, highlighting the key contributions of MADneSs.},

In particular, anomaly detection techniques are crucial to detect anomalous service behaviors that may lead to the violation of service level agreements (SLAs) drawn with users. This paper describes an anomaly detection system (ADS) designed to detect errors related to the erroneous behavior of the service, and SLA violations in cloud services. One major objective is to help providers to diagnose the anomalous virtual machines (VMs) on which a service is deployed as well as the type of error associated to the anomaly. Our ADS includes a system monitoring entity that collects software counters characterizing the cloud service, as well as a detection entity based on machine learning models. Additionally, a fault injection entity is integrated into the ADS for the training the machine learning models. This entity is also used to validate the ADS and to assess its anomaly detection and diagnosis performance. We validated our ADS with two case studies deployments: a NoSQL database, and a virtual IP Multimedia Subsystem developed implementing a virtual network function. Experimental results show that our ADS can achieve a high detection and diagnosis performance.},

	abstract = {Monitoring is the key to guarantee the reliability of cloud computing systems. By analyzing monitoring data, administrators can understand systems’ statuses to detect, diagnose and solve problems. However, due to the enormous scale and complex structure of cloud computing, a monitoring system should collect, transfer, store and process a large amount of monitoring data, which brings a significant performance overhead and increases the difficulty of analyzing useful information. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a self-adaptive monitoring approach for cloud computing systems. First, we conduct correlation analysis between different metrics, and monitor selected important ones which represent the others and reflect the running status of a system. Second, we characterize the running status with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), estimate the anomaly degree, and predict the possibility of faults. Finally, we dynamically adjust the monitoring period based on the estimated anomaly degree and a reliability model. To evaluate our proposal, we have applied the approach in our open-source TPC-W benchmark Bench4Q deployed in our real cloud computing platform OnceCloud. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can adapt to dynamic workloads, accurately estimate the anomaly degree, and automatically adjust monitoring periods. Thus, the approach can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of anomaly detection in an abnormal status, and efficiently lower the monitoring overhead in a normal status.},

The rapid growth of data volumes and computational complexity, especially for modern applications such as machine learning algorithms, imposes significant challenges to local HPC facilities. Many attempts have been made to burst HPC batch processing into clouds with virtual machines. They all suffer from some common issues, for example: very high overhead, slow to scale up and slow to scale down, and nearly impossible to be cloud-agnostic. We have successfully deployed and run several pipelines on Kubernetes in OpenStack, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. In particular, we use Kubeflow on top of Kubernetes for more sophisticated job scheduling, workflow management, and first class support for machine learning. We choose Kubeflow/Kubernetes to avoid the overhead of provisioning of virtual machines, to achieve rapid scaling with containers, and to be truly cloud-agnostic in all cloud environments. Kubeflow on Kubernetes also creates some new challenges in deployment, data access, performance monitoring, etc. We will discuss the details of these challenges and provide our solutions. We will demonstrate how our solutions work across all three very different clouds for both classical pipelines and new ones for machine learning.},

Moreover, containers are known to package and deploy applications consistently across varying infrastructures. Container orchestrators manage a large number of containers for microservices based cloud applications. However, the use of such service orchestration frameworks towards HPC workloads remains relatively unexplored. In this paper we study the potential use of Kubernetes on HPC infrastructure for use by the scientific community. We directly compare both its features and performance against Docker Swarm and bare metal execution of HPC applications. Herein, we detail the configurations required for Kubernetes to operate with containerized MPI applications, specifically accounting for operations such as (1) underlying device access, (2) inter-container communication across different hosts, and (3) configuration limitations. This evaluation quantifies the performance difference between representative MPI workloads running both on bare metal and containerized orchestration frameworks with Kubernetes, operating over both Ethernet and InfiniBand interconnects. Our results show that Kubernetes and Docker Swarm can achieve near bare metal performance over RDMA communication when high performance transports are enabled. Our results also show that Kubernetes presents overheads for several HPC applications over TCP/IP protocol. However, Docker Swarm's throughput is near bare metal performance for the same applications.},

Therefore, the usability, accessibility, and the security of these websites are very important. Accessibility is particularly crucial for persons with disabilities. The accessibility of public service websites is regulated by a number of laws; among others, the directive “on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies” adopted by the European Parliament in 2016. This obliges all European Union member states to make all public sector websites and mobile applications accessible by 23 September 2021. In practice, this means that websites must fulfil the level AA recommendations in WCAG 2.1. In our study, a website assessment method is developed by comparing different analytical tools. With this method, we analysed how Hungarian websites of public sector bodies fulfil the requirements of the directive. We have also investigated how well they comply with usability and security guidelines. The results showed that none of the 25 websites of the examined Hungarian public sector bodies could completely fulfil the recommendations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and that half of the websites had only the lowest level of compliance in usability tests. From the security point of view, almost half of the websites use outdated server versions and programming language, which is very critical. We have proposed several suggestions to address the major problems, so website developers and administrators can improve the accessibility, usability, and security aspects of these websites.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing promises to evolve cloud computing architecture from VMs and containers-as-a-service (CaaS) to function-as-a-service (FaaS). This takes away complexities of managing and scaling underlying infrastructure and can result in simpler code, cheaper realization of services, and higher availability. Nonetheless, one of the primary drawbacks customers face when making decision to move their software to a serverless platform is the potential for getting locked-in with a particular provider. This used to be a concern with Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings too. However with Kubernetes emerging as the industry standard PaaS layer, PaaS is closer to becoming commodity with the Kubernetes API as its common interface. The question is if a similar unification for the API interface layer and runtime contracts can be achieved for serverless. If achieved, this would free up serverless users from their fears of platform lock-in. Our goal in this paper is to extract a minimal common denominator model of execution that can move us closer to a unified serverless platform. As contributors to Knative [13] with in-depth understanding of its internal design, we use Knative as the baseline for this comparison and contrast its API interface and runtime contracts against other prominent serverless platforms to identify commonalities and differences. Influenced by the work in Knative, we also discuss challenges as well as the necessary evolution we expect to see as serverless platforms themselves reach commodity status.},

These challenges require that we look at all potential resources, assessing how efficiently we use them and that we explore different alternatives to exploit opportunistic resources in our infrastructure as well as outside of the CERN computing centre. Several projects, like BEER, Helix Nebula Science Cloud and the new OCRE project, have proven our ability to run batch workloads on a wide range of non-traditional resources. However, the challenge is not only to obtain the raw compute resources needed but how to define an operational model that is cost and time efficient, scalable and flexible enough to adapt to a heterogeneous infrastructure. In order to tackle both the provisioning and operational challenges it was decided to use Kubernetes. By using Kubernetes we benefit from a de-facto standard in containerised environments, available in nearly all cloud providers and surrounded by a vibrant ecosystem of open-source projects. Leveraging Kubernetes’ built-in functionality, and other open-source tools such as Helm, Terraform and GitLab CI, we have deployed a first cluster prototype which we discuss in detail. The effort has simplified many of the existing operational procedures we currently have, but has also made us rethink established procedures and assumptions that were only valid in a VM-based cloud environment. This contribution presents how we have adopted Kubernetes into the CERN Batch Service, the impact its adoption has in daily operations, a comparison on resource usage efficiency and the experience so far evolving our infrastructure towards this model.},

We have taken wild barley (Hordeum spp.) and potato (Solanum spp.) collections along with wheat (Triticum spp.) and maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) and their wild relatives and incorporated this data into web-based information resources built using the Germinate platform (https://ics. hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate, accessed 4 Apr. 2017). We have tailored these to better meet the demands of researchers by developing both new data visualization tools and integration with current software such as Helium, Flapjack, and CurlyWhirly (https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/software, accessed 4 Apr. 2017) and presented the data in a common platform. While the underlying species differ, the approach taken ensures that tools are compatible across all database instances. We will describe these database instances and show that Germinate offers a common platform that will aid in the exploration and wider use of these species. P.D. Shaw, S. Raubach, I. Milne, G.

The analysis is described by means of a YAML file that captures sufficient information about the analysis assets, parameters and processes. The REANA platform consists of a set of micro-services allowing to launch and monitor container-based computational workflow jobs on the cloud. The REANA user interface and the command-line client enables researchers to easily rerun analysis workflows with new input parameters. The REANA platform aims at supporting several container technologies (Docker), workflow engines (CWL, Yadage), shared storage systems (Ceph, EOS) and compute cloud infrastructures (Ku-bernetes/OpenStack, HTCondor) used by the community.REANA was developed with the particle physics use case in mind and profits from synergies with general reusable research data analysis patterns in other scientific disciplines, such as bioinformatics and life sciences.},

In the present task subjects control a simulated, remotely operated robotic arm, attempting to dock onto a satellite in orbit. The proposed methodology utilizes the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm to distinguish operators by their unique control behaviors. Results presented compare the identification performance of HTM with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Edit Distance on Real Sequences (EDR), in both static and real-time data settings. The HTM method outperformed both DTW and EDR in the real- time setting, and matched DTW in the static setting. Observed superior performance of the HTM algorithm lays the foundation for the extension of the proposed methodology to other motion- monitoring applications, such as real-time workload assessment, motion/simulator sickness onset or distraction detection.The data gathered in the study was posted to IEEE-dataport, DOI: 10.21227/wpyf-r927},

	abstract = {Our knowledge of the brain has evolved over millennia in philosophical, experimental and theoretical phases. We suggest that the next phase is simulation neuroscience. The main drivers of simulation neuroscience are big data generated at multiple levels of brain organization and the need to integrate these data to trace the causal chain of interactions within and across all these levels. Simulation neuroscience is currently the only methodology for systematically approaching the multiscale brain. In this review, we attempt to reconstruct the deep historical paths leading to simulation neuroscience, from the first observations of the nerve cell to modern efforts to digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain. Neuroscience began with the identification of the neuron as the fundamental unit of brain structure and function and has evolved towards understanding the role of each cell type in the brain, how brain cells are connected to each other, and how the seemingly infinite networks they form give rise to the vast diversity of brain functions. Neuronal mapping is evolving from subjective descriptions of cell types towards objective classes, subclasses and types. Connectivity mapping is evolving from loose topographic maps between brain regions towards dense anatomical and physiological maps of connections between individual genetically distinct neurons. Functional mapping is evolving from psychological and behavioral stereotypes towards a map of behaviors emerging from structural and functional connectomes. We show how industrialization of neuroscience and the resulting large disconnected datasets are generating demand for integrative neuroscience, how the scale of neuronal and connectivity maps is driving digital atlasing and digital reconstruction to piece together the multiple levels of brain organization, and how the complexity of the interactions between molecules, neurons, microcircuits and brain regions is driving brain simulation to understand the interactions in the multiscale brain.},

Designing classifiers that achieve optimal differential response between specific cell types is a hard computational problem because it involves selection of endogenous inputs and optimization of both biochemical parameters and a logic function. To address this problem, we first derive an optimal set of biochemical parameters with the largest expected differential response over a diverse set of logic circuits, and second, we use these parameters in an evolutionary algorithm to select circuit inputs and optimize the logic function. Using this approach, we design experimentally feasible microRNA-based circuits capable of perfect discrimination for several real-world cell-classification tasks. We also find that under realistic cell-to-cell variation, circuit performance is comparable to standard cross-validation performance estimates. Our approach facilitates the generation of candidate circuits for experimental testing in therapeutic settings that require precise cell targeting, such as cancer therapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For example, anticancer therapies could be engineered to detect and respond to complex cellular conditions in individual cells with high specificity. Here, we show a scalable transcriptional/posttranscriptional synthetic regulatory circuit--a cell-type "classifier"--that senses expression levels of a customizable set of endogenous microRNAs and triggers a cellular response only if the expression levels match a predetermined profile of interest. We demonstrate that a HeLa cancer cell classifier selectively identifies HeLa cells and triggers apoptosis without affecting non-HeLa cell types. This approach also provides a general platform for programmed responses to other complex cell states.},

In this review, miRNAs are discussed as biomarkers for cancer and other diseases, including viral infections, nervous system disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes. We summarize some of the clinical evidence for the use of miRNAs as biomarkers in diagnostics and provide some general perspectives on their use in clinical situations. The analytical challenges in using miRNAs in cancer and disease diagnostics are evaluated and discussed. Validation of specific miRNA signatures as biomarkers is a critical milestone in diagnostics.

Such remapping is thought to emerge by the switching of input patterns from specialized spatially selective cells in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), such as grid and border cells. Although it has been shown that acute manipulations of mEC firing patterns are sufficient for inducing hippocampal remapping, it remains unknown whether specialized spatial mEC inputs are necessary for the reorganization of hippocampal spatial representations. Here, we examined remapping in rats without mEC input to the hippocampus and found that highly distinct spatial maps emerged rapidly in every individual rat.

For a very general class of local rules, we prove convergence and provide a certain member of this class that, when applied on a graph, efficiently computes its k-core and its (k-1)-crust giving hints on the expressive power of such a model. Furthermore, we provide guarantees on the speed of convergence for an important subclass of the aforementioned class. We also study more general rules, and show that they do not converge. Our counterexamples resolve an open question of (Zhang, Wang, Wang, Zhou, KDD- 2009) as well, concerning whether a certain process converges.

Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent the location of an animal in its environment. Recent evidence suggests that grid cell-like neurons may also be present in the neocortex. We propose that grid cells exist throughout the neocortex, in every region and in every cortical column. They define a location-based framework for how the neocortex functions. Whereas grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent the location of one thing, the body relative to its environment, we propose that cortical grid cells simultaneously represent the location of many things. Cortical columns in somatosensory cortex track the location of tactile features relative to the object being touched and cortical columns in visual cortex track the location of visual features relative to the object being viewed. We propose that mechanisms in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that evolved for learning the structure of environments are now used by the neocortex to learn the structure of objects. Having a representation of location in each cortical column suggests mechanisms for how the neocortex represents object compositionality and object behaviors. It leads to the hypothesis that every part of the neocortex learns complete models of objects and that there are many models of each object distributed throughout the neocortex. The similarity of circuitry observed in all cortical regions is strong evidence that even high-level cognitive tasks are learned and represented in a location-based framework.},

The formulas are presented and drawbacks are discussed for every accuracy measurements. To reduce the impact of outliers, an Integral Normalized Mean Square Error have been proposed. Due to the fact that each error measure has the disadvantages that can lead to inaccurate evaluation of the forecasting results, it is impossible to choose only one measure, the recommendations for selecting the appropriate error measurements are given.},

One form of experimentally observed long-term synaptic plasticity, which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},

In addition we include the observation that strong synapses undergo relatively less potentiation than weak synapses, whereas depression is independent of synaptic strength. After random stimulation, the synaptic weights reach an equilibrium distribution which is stable, unimodal, and has positive skew. This weight distribution compares favorably to the distributions of quantal amplitudes and of receptor number observed experimentally in central neurons and contrasts to the distribution found in plasticity models without size-dependent potentiation. Also in contrast to those models, which show strong competition between the synapses, stable plasticity is achieved with little competition. Instead, competition can be introduced by including a separate mechanism that scales synaptic strengths multiplicatively as a function of postsynaptic activity. In this model, synaptic weights change in proportion to how correlated they are with other inputs onto the same postsynaptic neuron. These results indicate that stable correlation-based plasticity can be achieved without introducing competition, suggesting that plasticity and competition need not coexist in all circuits or at all developmental stages.},

It converts arbitrary binary input patterns into sparse distributed representations (SDRs) using a combination of competitive Hebbian learning rules and homeostatic excitability control. We describe a number of key properties of the spatial pooler, including fast adaptation to changing input statistics, improved noise robustness through learning, efficient use of cells and robustness to cell death. In order to quantify these properties we develop a set of metrics that can be directly computed from the spatial pooler outputs. We show how the properties are met using these metrics and targeted artificial simulations. We then demonstrate the value of the spatial pooler in a complete end-to-end real-world HTM system. We discuss the relationship with neuroscience and previous studies of sparse coding. The HTM spatial pooler represents a neurally inspired algorithm for learning sparse representations from noisy data streams in an online fashion.},

	abstract = {The ability to recognize and predict temporal sequences of sensory inputs is vital for survival in natural environments. Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.},

We then describe specific spatial pooling and temporal memory implementations, as well as simulations demonstrating that the fundamental properties are maintained. We discuss issues in implementing the full set of plasticity rules using Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), and rough place and route calculations. Although further work is required, our initial studies indicate that it should be possible to run large-scale HTM networks (including plasticity rules) efficiently on the Heidelberg platform.

The reconstruction uses cellular and synaptic organizing principles to algorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy and physiology from sparse experimental data. An objective anatomical method defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 ± 0.01 mm(3) containing {\textasciitilde}31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specific morphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their overlapping arbors form {\textasciitilde}8 million connections with {\textasciitilde}37 million synapses. Simulations reproduce an array of in vitro and in vivo experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a spectrum of network states with a sharp transition from synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological mechanisms. The spectrum of network states, dynamically reconfigured around this transition, supports diverse information processing strategies.

Some layers have long-range excitatory lateral connections suggesting interactions between columns. Similar patterns of connectivity exist in all regions but their exact role remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. Each column integrates its changing input over time to learn complete predictive models of observed objects. Excitatory lateral connections across columns allow the network to more rapidly infer objects based on the partial knowledge of adjacent columns. Because columns integrate input over time and space, the network learns models of complex objects that extend well beyond the receptive field of individual cells. Our network model introduces a new feature to cortical columns. We propose that a representation of location relative to the object being sensed is calculated within the sub-granular layers of each column. The location signal is provided as an input to the network, where it is combined with sensory data. Our model contains two layers and one or more columns. Simulations show that using Hebbian-like learning rules small single-column networks can learn to recognize hundreds of objects, with each object containing tens of features. Multi-column networks recognize objects with significantly fewer movements of the sensory receptors. Given the ubiquity of columnar and laminar connectivity patterns throughout the neocortex, we propose that columns and regions have more powerful recognition and modeling capabilities than previously assumed.},

	abstract = {Pyramidal neurons represent the majority of excitatory neurons in the neocortex. Each pyramidal neuron receives input from thousands of excitatory synapses that are segregated onto dendritic branches. The dendrites themselves are segregated into apical, basal, and proximal integration zones, which have different properties. It is a mystery how pyramidal neurons integrate the input from thousands of synapses, what role the different dendrites play in this integration, and what kind of network behavior this enables in cortical tissue. It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable cortical neurons to recognize multiple independent patterns. In this paper we extend this idea in multiple ways. First we show that a neuron with several thousand synapses segregated on active dendrites can recognize hundreds of independent patterns of cellular activity even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation. We then propose a neuron model where patterns detected on proximal dendrites lead to action potentials, defining the classic receptive field of the neuron, and patterns detected on basal and apical dendrites act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without generating an action potential. By this mechanism, a neuron can predict its activation in hundreds of independent contexts. We then present a network model based on neurons with these properties that learns time-based sequences. The network relies on fast local inhibition to preferentially activate neurons that are slightly depolarized. Through simulation we show that the network scales well and operates robustly over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular activations. We contrast the properties of the new network model with several other neural network models to illustrate the relative capabilities of each. We conclude that pyramidal neurons with thousands of synapses, active dendrites, and multiple integration zones create a robust and powerful sequence memory. Given the prevalence and similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose that this form of sequence memory may be a universal property of neocortical tissue.},

	abstract = {The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

	abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A ‘column’ now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term ‘column’ also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

	abstract = {The concept of the cortical column refers to vertical cell bands with similar response properties, which were initially observed by Vernon Mountcastle’s mapping of single cell recordings in the cat somatic cortex. It has subsequently guided over 50 years of neuroscientific research, in which fundamental questions about the modularity of the cortex and basic principles of sensory information processing were empirically investigated. Nevertheless, the status of the column remains controversial today, as skeptical commentators proclaim that the vertical cell bands are a functionally insignificant by-product of ontogenetic development. This paper inquires how the column came to be viewed as an elementary unit of the cortex from Mountcastle’s discovery in 1955 until David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel’s reception of the Nobel Prize in 1981. I first argue that Mountcastle’s vertical electrode recordings served as criteria for applying the column concept to electrophysiological data. In contrast to previous authors, I claim that this move from electrophysiological data to the phenomenon of columnar responses was concept-laden, but not theory-laden. In the second part of the paper, I argue that Mountcastle’s criteria provided Hubel Wiesel with a conceptual outlook, i.e. it allowed them to anticipate columnar patterns in the cat and macaque visual cortex. I argue that in the late 1970s, this outlook only briefly took a form that one could call a ‘theory’ of the cerebral cortex, before new experimental techniques started to diversify column research. I end by showing how this account of early column research fits into a larger project that follows the conceptual development of the column into the present.},

Transfer learning is a new machine learning method that uses existing knowledge to solve different but related domain problems. It relaxes two basic assumptions in traditional machine learning: (1) Training samples for learning and new test samples satisfy the conditions of independent and identical distribution; (2) There must be enough training samples available to learn a good model. Since it is costly and dangerous to repeat testing flights at extreme conditions, building an anomaly detection model for aircraft flight is also constrained by insufficient samples in limited data for different testing flight scenarios. To handle the insufficient samples, we propose a transfer-learning based approach to establishing an anomaly detection model for dangerous actions of aircraft testing flights. In our approach, we transfer the "knowledge" obtained in some testing scenarios to other scenarios containing dangerous action. Evaluation results indicate that our approach works well in terms of convincing accuracy in prediction by models in target scenarios transferred from source scenarios.},

	abstract = {Recently, incremental and on-line learning gained more attention especially in the context of big data and learning from data streams, conflicting with the traditional assumption of complete data availability. Even though a variety of different methods are available, it often remains unclear which of them is suitable for a specific task and how they perform in comparison to each other. We analyze the key properties of eight popular incremental methods representing different algorithm classes. Thereby, we evaluate them with regards to their on-line classification error as well as to their behavior in the limit. Further, we discuss the often neglected issue of hyperparameter optimization specifically for each method and test how robustly it can be done based on a small set of examples. Our extensive evaluation on data sets with different characteristics gives an overview of the performance with respect to accuracy, convergence speed as well as model complexity, facilitating the choice of the best method for a given application.},

	abstract = {In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), an enormous amount of sensing devices collect and/or generate various sensory data over time for a wide range of fields and applications. Based on the nature of the application, these devices will result in big or fast/real-time data streams. Applying analytics over such data streams to discover new information, predict future insights, and make control decisions is a crucial process that makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses and a quality-of-life improving technology. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine learning techniques, namely deep learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and learning in the IoT domain. We start by articulating IoT data characteristics and identifying two major treatments for IoT data from a machine learning perspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics. We also discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in these types of data and applications. The potential of using emerging DL techniques for IoT data analytics are then discussed, and its promises and challenges are introduced. We present a comprehensive background on different DL architectures and algorithms. We also analyze and summarize major reported research attempts that leveraged DL in the IoT domain. The smart IoT devices that have incorporated DL in their intelligence background are also discussed. DL implementation approaches on the fog and cloud centers in support of IoT applications are also surveyed. Finally, we shed light on some challenges and potential directions for future research. At the end of each section, we highlight the lessons learned based on our experiments and review of the recent literature.},

Our algorithmic innovations include a fast numerical optimization routine for Bayesian posterior inference and a statistically efficient scheme for decomposing astronomical optimization problems into subproblems. Our scalable implementation is written entirely in Julia, a new high-level dynamic programming language designed for scientific and numerical computing.

	volume = {12},
	issn = {1879-2782},
	abstract = {The classical notion that the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are dedicated to motor control is under dispute given increasing evidence of their involvement in non-motor functions. Is it then impossible to characterize the functions of the cerebellum, the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex in a simplistic manner? This paper presents a novel view that their computational roles can be characterized not by asking what are the "goals" of their computation, such as motor or sensory, but by asking what are the "methods" of their computation, specifically, their learning algorithms. There is currently enough anatomical, physiological, and theoretical evidence to support the hypotheses that the cerebellum is a specialized organism for supervised learning, the basal ganglia are for reinforcement learning, and the cerebral cortex is for unsupervised learning.This paper investigates how the learning modules specialized for these three kinds of learning can be assembled into goal-oriented behaving systems. In general, supervised learning modules in the cerebellum can be utilized as "internal models" of the environment. Reinforcement learning modules in the basal ganglia enable action selection by an "evaluation" of environmental states. Unsupervised learning modules in the cerebral cortex can provide statistically efficient representation of the states of the environment and the behaving system. Two basic action selection architectures are shown, namely, reactive action selection and predictive action selection. They can be implemented within the anatomical constraint of the network linking these structures. Furthermore, the use of the cerebellar supervised learning modules for state estimation, behavioral simulation, and encapsulation of learned skill is considered. Finally, the usefulness of such theoretical frameworks in interpreting brain imaging data is demonstrated in the paradigm of procedural learning.},

The ease of culturing and experimenting with Physarum makes this slime mould an ideal substrate for real-world implementations of unconventional sensing and computing devices The book is a treatise of theoretical and experimental laboratory studies on sensing and computing properties of slime mould, and on the development of mathematical and logical theories of Physarum behavior. It is shown how to make logical gates and circuits, electronic devices (memristors, diodes, transistors, wires, chemical and tactile sensors) with the slime mould. The book demonstrates how to modify properties of Physarum computing circuits with functional nano-particles and polymers, to interface the slime mould with field-programmable arrays, and to use Physarum as a controller of microbial fuel cells. A unique multi-agent model of slime is shown to serve well as a software slime mould capable for solving problems of computational geometry and graph optimization. The multiagent model is complemented by cellular automata models with parallel accelerations. Presented mathematical models inspired by Physarum include non-quantum implementation of Shor's factorization, structural learning, computation of shortest path tree on dynamic graphs, supply chain network design, p-adic computing and syllogistic reasoning. The book is a unique composition of vibrant and lavishly illustrated essays which will inspire scientists, engineers and artists to exploit natural phenomena in designs of future and emergent computing and sensing devices. It is a 'bible' of experimental computing with spatially extended living substrates, it spanstopics from biology of slime mould, to bio-sensing, to unconventional computing devices and robotics, non-classical logics and music and arts.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

	abstract = {SummaryIs there an “essence of intelligence” that distinguishes intelligent systems from non-intelligent systems? If there is, then what is it? This chapter suggests an answer to these questions by introducing the ideas behind the NARS (Nonaxiomatic Reasoning System) project. NARS is based on the opinion that the essence of intelligence is the ability to adapt with insufficient knowledge and resources. According to this belief, the author has designed a novel formal logic, and implemented it in a computer system. Such a “logic of intelligence” provides a unified explanation for many cognitive functions of the human mind, and is also concrete enough to guide the actual building of a general purpose “thinking machine”.},

	abstract = {In the early 1950s, as calculating machines were coming into their own, a few pioneer thinkers began to realise that digital computers could be more than number-crunchers. At that point two opposed visions of what computers could be, each with its correlated research programme, emerged and struggled for recognition. One faction saw computers as a system for manipulating mental symbols; the other, as a medium for modelling the brain. One sought to use computers to instantiate a formal representation of the world; the other, to simulate the interactions of neurons. One took problem solving as its paradigm of intelligence; the other, learning. One utilised logic; the other, statistics. One school was the heir to the rationalist, reductionist tradition in philosophy; the other viewed itself as idealised, holistic neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Intelligence has evolved many times independently among vertebrates. Primates, elephants and cetaceans are assumed to be more intelligent than ‘lower’ mammals, the great apes and humans more than monkeys, and humans more than the great apes. Brain properties assumed to be relevant for intelligence are the (absolute or relative) size of the brain, cortex, prefrontal cortex and degree of encephalization. However, factors that correlate better with intelligence are the number of cortical neurons and conduction velocity, as the basis for information-processing capacity. Humans have more cortical neurons than other mammals, although only marginally more than whales and elephants. The outstanding intelligence of humans appears to result from a combination and enhancement of properties found in non-human primates, such as theory of mind, imitation and language, rather than from ‘unique’ properties.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper we approach this problem in the following way: we take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is related to the theory of universal optimal learning agents. Finally, we survey the many other tests and definitions of intelligence that have been proposed for machines.},

The present study assessed three specific executive abilities – updating, shifting, and inhibition – and examined their common and differential relations to fluid intelligence and creativity (i.e., divergent thinking ability) within a latent variable model approach. Additionally, it was tested whether the correlation of fluid intelligence and creativity can be explained by a common executive involvement. As expected, fluid intelligence was strongly predicted by updating, but not by shifting or inhibition. Creativity was predicted by updating and inhibition, but not by shifting. Moreover, updating (and the personality factor openness) was found to explain a relevant part of the shared variance between intelligence and creativity. The findings provide direct support for the executive involvement in creative thought and shed further light on the functional relationship between intelligence and creativity.},

	abstract = {The relationship between intelligence and creativity has been subject to empirical research for decades. Nevertheless, there is yet no consensus on how these constructs are related. One of the most prominent notions concerning the interplay between intelligence and creativity is the threshold hypothesis, which assumes that above-average intelligence represents a necessary condition for high-level creativity. While earlier research mostly supported the threshold hypothesis, it has come under fire in recent investigations. The threshold hypothesis is commonly investigated by splitting a sample at a given threshold (e.g., at 120 IQ points) and estimating separate correlations for lower and upper IQ ranges. However, there is no compelling reason why the threshold should be fixed at an IQ of 120, and to date, no attempts have been made to detect the threshold empirically. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between intelligence and different indicators of creative potential and of creative achievement by means of segmented regression analysis in a sample of 297 participants. Segmented regression allows for the detection of a threshold in continuous data by means of iterative computational algorithms. We found thresholds only for measures of creative potential but not for creative achievement. For the former the thresholds varied as a function of criteria: When investigating a liberal criterion of ideational originality (i.e., two original ideas), a threshold was detected at around 100 IQ points. In contrast, a threshold of 120 IQ points emerged when the criterion was more demanding (i.e., many original ideas). Moreover, an IQ of around 85 IQ points was found to form the threshold for a purely quantitative measure of creative potential (i.e., ideational fluency). These results confirm the threshold hypothesis for qualitative indicators of creative potential and may explain some of the observed discrepancies in previous research. In addition, we obtained evidence that once the intelligence threshold is met, personality factors become more predictive for creativity. On the contrary, no threshold was found for creative achievement, i.e. creative achievement benefits from higher intelligence even at fairly high levels of intellectual ability.},

This broader view of adaptive behavior has been a major underpinning of ecological psychology and has influenced behavior-based robotics. Computational neuroethology, which jointly models neural control and periphery of animals, is a promising methodology for understanding adaptive behavior.},

	abstract = {\&quot;Although I cannot tell for certain what sparked my interest in the neural underpinnings of reason, I do know when I became convinced that the traditional views on the nature of rationality could not be correct.\&quot; Thus begins a book that takes the reader on a journey of discovery, from the story of Phineas Gage, the famous nineteenth-century case of behavioral change that followed brain damage, to the contemporary recreation of Gage\&\#39;s brain; and from the doubts of a young neurologist to a testable hypothesis concerning the emotions and their fundamental role in rational human behavior. Drawing on his experiences with neurological patients affected by brain damage (his laboratory is recognized worldwide as the foremost center for the study of such patients), Antonio Damasio shows how the absence of emotion and feeling can break down rationality. In the course of explaining how emotions and feelings contribute to reason and to adaptive social behavior, Damasio also offers a novel perspective on what emotions and feelings actually are: a direct sensing of our own body states, a link between the body and its survival-oriented regulations, on the one hand, and consciousness, on the other. Descartes\&\#39; Error leads us to conclude that human organisms are endowed from the very beginning with a spirited passion for making choices, which the social mind can use to build rational behavior.},
